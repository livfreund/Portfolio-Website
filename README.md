# Portfolio-Website

I am currently working on my very own personal portfolio website -- coming soon!

used youtube tutoital but customized it by adding the dark mode, and changing some of the layout. 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Document Object Modeling
Scalability -- ability to neatly consolidate on smaller screens *-- difficulty 
Dark Mode
localStorage maniputlaion, remember which mode it was in when refreshed 
first navigation menu & hamburger navigation 
learned a lot - went through every bit of the code to ensure I understood why I wrote what I did
