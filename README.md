### Portfolio-Website
This portfolio website is meant to display my web development skills as well as serve as my personal professional portfolio. 
Since I am an incomiing graduate student at Boston University who will be studying software development, in the fall, 
my web development still are certainly in the beginner stages. For this reason, I utilized the help of a tutorial YouTube video to help me along. 
However, I want to make it clear that although I used a tutorial to assist in making this website from scratch, 
I placed descriptive comments throughout the code to ensure I understood every part as I wrote it, and I am fully knowledgable on all of the working parts of this website. 
Furthermore, I also customized it to my liking by adding a dark mode and customzing the layout to accomodate my information. 

## Languages Used: 
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Concepts Learned:
While completing this project, I learned in a hands-on way about many essential web development concepts. 
# Local Storage Manipulation 
First, I learned about Local Storage and how to manipulate it to serve my needs. I needed my website to remmeber the user's
preference on if the dark mode switch had been toggled or not, meaning I wanted the page to stay in whichever mode the user had
chosen even if the page were refreshed. I did not want it to default back to it's original state. This was an interesting concept
to learn becuase I had previosuly not considered that the local storage would need to be manipulated often within web development. 
# Responsiveness
Next, I learned about the importance of a website's ability to be resposive across all screen sizes. This was also 
something that is a very important aspect of web development that I had previosuly not considered. It is very enlightening to see things from
the perspective of the developer of the web, not the user. I learned about how the use of media queries can make a website responsive to fit the sizes 
of all screens. 
# The "Inspect" Tool
I learned that when you right click on any website you can see the HTML used to create it, and when you use it on a website you built yourself, 
that you can use this as a very useful debugging tool. When the man in the tutorial I followed taught me about this tool, I was very interested 
and found it to be very uyseful as I continued the completion of my portfolio website.
