# Portfolio-Website
This portfolio showcases my foundational web development skills and serves as a professional introduction to my work. As an incoming graduate student at 
Boston University studying software development, I recognize that I’m early in my journey. To support my learning, I referenced a 
tutorial video to help guide the website’s construction.

While the tutorial provided structural guidance, I built the site from scratch, embedded descriptive comments throughout the code to ensure clarity, and developed a deep understanding of every component. Additionally, I customized the project by incorporating a dark mode feature and redesigning the layout to better align with my professional goals.

### Languages Used: 
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Concepts Learned:
### Local Storage Manipulation 
I implemented local storage to retain the user's dark mode preference—even after refreshing the page—enhancing the site's usability and personalization.
### Responsiveness
I learned about the importance of a website's ability to be resposive across all screen sizes. This is a very important aspect of web development 
that I had previosuly not considered. It is very enlightening to see things from
the perspective of the developer of the web, not the user. I learned about how the use of media queries can make a website responsive to fit the sizes 
of all screens. 
### Developer Tools for Debugging
I explored the "Inspect" tool for real-time debugging and layout troubleshooting. This approach greatly improved my 
efficiency during development and deepened my understanding of HTML structure. 
### Document Object Model (DOM)
While previously introduced to the DOM concept, this project allowed me to actively apply it, targeting 
specific elements for dynamic behavior—such as toggling dark mode and managing the hamburger menu.
### Difference Between Units of Measuremnt used in HTML
I learned the differences between px, rem, and %, and how each affects scalability and responsiveness. As the proejct went on, I found myself 
partial to the % because it is relative to the size of the parent element, which I found to be more responsive and scalable over time. 
### Website Deployment
I deployed the final site independently using Netlify—a milestone for me, as previous web projects were passed to supervisors for deployment.

## Difficulties Encountered: 
Building this portfolio was challenging—even with a tutorial as a guide. Customizing features such as dark mode and layout presented unexpected bugs that weren’t present in the source video allowed 
me to troubleshoot independently, and I am grateful for the opportunity. These challenges made the experience feel genuinely rewarding, and I’m proud of both the functionality and the display. 
I feel this project was a perfect mix of hand-on learning and also incorporating my own twists and elements into the website, and 
I am proud of how I adapted and learned throughout this process. Furthermore, I am excited to 
immerse myself more into the world of web development where I can discover and development more of my personal aesthetic touch!
