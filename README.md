# Portfolio-Website
This portfolio website is meant to display my web development skills as well as serve as my personal professional portfolio. 
Since I am an incomiing graduate student at Boston University who will be studying software development, in the fall, 
my web development still are certainly in the beginner stages. For this reason, I utilized the help of a tutorial YouTube video to help me along. 
However, I want to make it clear that although I used a tutorial to assist in making this website from scratch, 
I placed descriptive comments throughout the code to ensure I understood every part as I wrote it, and I am fully knowledgable on all of the working parts of this website. 
Furthermore, I also customized it to my liking by adding a dark mode and customzing the layout to accomodate my information.

### Languages Used: 
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Concepts Learned:
While completing this project, I learned in a hands-on way about many essential web development concepts. 
### Local Storage Manipulation 
First, I learned about Local Storage and how to manipulate it to serve my needs. I needed my website to remmeber the user's
preference on if the dark mode switch had been toggled or not, meaning I wanted the page to stay in whichever mode the user had
chosen even if the page were refreshed. I did not want it to default back to it's original state. This was an interesting concept
to learn becuase I had previosuly not considered that the local storage would need to be manipulated often within web development. 
### Responsiveness
Next, I learned about the importance of a website's ability to be resposive across all screen sizes. This was also 
something that is a very important aspect of web development that I had previosuly not considered. It is very enlightening to see things from
the perspective of the developer of the web, not the user. I learned about how the use of media queries can make a website responsive to fit the sizes 
of all screens. 
### The "Inspect" Tool
I learned that when you right click on any website you can see the HTML used to create it, and when you use it on a website you built yourself, 
that you can use this as a very useful debugging tool. When the man in the tutorial I followed taught me about this tool, I was very interested 
and found it to be very uyseful as I continued the completion of my portfolio website. 
### Document Object Modeling
Furthermore, I also learned more about Document Object Modeling. I had encounted Document Object Modeling in previous academic and previous projects, 
but I would not say that I had ever fully understood it. During this project, I though it beneficial to dig deeper into what exactly Direct Object Modeling is. I learned Direct Object Modeling to be 
a way to target a specific elelemnt so that it can be used. It is easy to see why this would be a common concept used in web development given all of the seperate elements 
and containers that come together to create the complete webpage. I used Direct Object Modeling for the Hamburger Icon and for my Dark Mode Toggle. 
### Difference Between Units of Measuremnt used in HTML
Next, although this may seem basic, I learned about the diference in units of measuremnet used in HTML. I noticed that there are px, rem, and %, and I had wantd to know
under which circumstancces each one is used instead of just using one. I learned that pixels represent fixed sizes, and that rem and % represent relative units that 
depend on the size of the parent element or the font size of the root element. As the proejct went on, I found myself partial to the % because it is relative to the size 
of the parent element, which I found to be more responsive and scalable over different screen sizes. 
### How to Deploy A Website
Lastly, I learned how to deploy my own website. In past web development projects, I made the website but then passed it on to my supervisor
who then took it from there. However, in this instance it was up to me deploy the website for myself, which I was excited about. 

## Difficulties Encountered: 
In all honesty, I found the creation of this project to be quite challenging, even with the help of the tutorial video. 
Although it gave me a lot of guidance and structure, there were still things I wanted to change about my website in comparison 
to the tutorial's, like adding the dark mode and changing some of the layout. Furthermore, there we some bugs that showed up 
in my code but did not show up in the tutorial's for reasons I do not know, so it was up to me to find a way to fix it. 
For these reasons, I feel this project was a perfect mix of hand-on learning and also incorporating my own twists and elements into the website, and 
I am proud of how I adapted and learned throughout this process.
